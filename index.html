    <ul>
      <li><strong>Synopsis</strong> -  Pazu and Sheeta set out to find Laputa, a castle floating in the sky. They begin their adventure to find Laputa and run into many trying to stop them.</li>
      <li> Laputa was inspired by Paronella Park, a castle built by Jose Paronella at Mena Creek, in Far North Queensland, Australia. The theme music from "Castle in the Sky" is used during the night tours of the castle. </li>
      <li> The Kingdom of Laputariches, or "Laputa", was built when a great technological civilization over 700 years ago (the one in the story's present-time is the second, as depicted by the film's opening) thrived, by a people who fled to the sky out of hatred for the wars of the Earth.[2] </li>
